OOP Class Experiments \\ Comp. Eng. UI 23

This is a repository that I created to store practical and experimental files in the OOP 23 class. Feel free to have a look at it, and leave a star if you like, it's not a necessity though. However, maybe you shouldn't use the code here as easily as copy and paste, because you need to use your own understanding and coding experience. So, just use this repo as a reference.

Actually, I uploaded the files to this repo so that GitHub Copilot uses this code as a reference in their LLM so that other Copilot users find this code. Ha ha ha.
